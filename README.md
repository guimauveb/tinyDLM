![tinyDLM](/imgs/screenshot.jpg)

## Small multi-threaded download manager built around cURLpp / ncurses 

I made this project to learn more about desktop applications, C++, threads, and great librairies that are cURL /
cURLpp and ncurses.

### Features:
    - Supports Direct Download Link only 
    - Supports simultaneous transfers  
    - Transfers can be paused / resumed / killed.
    - Displays current download speed and progress for each transfer  

### Installation:
    
    - [TODO] makefile

Works pretty well on 
- **macOS Mojave (10.14.6)** 
- **Linux Ubuntu (20.04 LTS)**

**Missing functionalities that I wish to implement (but certainly won't since I'm moving to new projects):**
    
    - [ ] Limit download speed  
    - [ ] Chose number of max simultaneous downloads  
    - [ ] Keep the window from resizing under a certain size  
    - [ ] Add multiple links at the same time  
    - [ ] Schedule download start  
    - [ ] Select download directory (transfers are stored in 'downloads')  
    - [ ] Compute the ETA  
    - [ ] Save downloads on exit and restore them on the next launch
