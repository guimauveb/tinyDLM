![tinyDLM](/imgs/screenshot.jpg)

## Small multi-threaded download manager built around cURLpp / ncurses 

I made this project to learn more about desktop applications, C++, threads, cURL / cURLpp and ncurses.

### Features:
    - Supports Direct Download Link only 
    - Supports simultaneous transfers  
    - Transfers can be paused / resumed / killed.
    - Displays current download speed and progress for each transfer  
    - Very low CPU / memory consumption
    - **NEW** Partially supports adding multiple links at the same time
